    /*
- If the robot cannot find any rooms it has not explored, it is done searching.
• Otherwise, it is done when finding its target.  Print a message in commemoration of this occasion and refrain
from destroying any present humans.
• When traversing the labyrinth, it considers adjacent rooms and will attempt  to visit rooms  that are most
expensive to reach first.
• It moves to the next room (as per above) or if there are no adjacent rooms left to search, it returns to the
previous room to try another room if available (DFS).
• Once  the  search  has  been  completed,  print  out  the  order  that  the  rooms  were  searched,  and  the  total
amount  of  fuel  the  path  would  cost.    (Sum  up  the  cost  of  all  the  moves  between  rooms  explored,
backtracking costs nothing.  Why doesn’t it always move backwards then?).
