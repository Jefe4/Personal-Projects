<p1> This was an amazing expierence playing through as the gameplay flowed well with good mechanics.
  As a fan of the first game The Last of Us which was Game of the Year with a list of other well respected awards.
  The story of TLOU2 was a let down compared to the previous installement. As the opening weekend for the release
  of the TLOU2 with user critcs plummeting as majority of players were upset with the story while the game scores across
  major platform were 9/10 or 10/10. Which is a success as a game but a failure in satisfiating the fan ban. Also, with report
  of Naughty Dog overworking the employees with crunchtime which lasted for weeks. Still was a great game but maybe Naughty Dog can learn
  from their mistakes to make future titles a true masterpiece. </p>

<p2>
  This game should've won the Game of the Year as it was the fan favorite winning by the landslide even beating TLOU2. With only bring home one award which doesn't truly appearicate how amazing that game is.
  With a unique and yet satisfiating combat system that rewarded you for exploring the world to find materials to upgrade Jin the main character. The scenery is beautiful and rich in color in details with the environment
  which led them to winning Best Art Direction award. Also winning best game award in Japan which is the first American made game to win it there.
  The game was about when the Mongol Empire invaded Tsushima in 1274.
  The showed the Japanese culture and customs they do in the game as the characters would often bow to show respect and variety of other customs. This brought awareness to the gamers of Japanese culture
  and insight of the invasion that happened. The game recieved a 9/10 from IGN as it's a game worth playing.
