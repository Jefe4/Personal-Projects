# When do we use elif in python? - It's used to include multiple conditional expression between if and else.
# Why do we need to indent for if,elif,else? - The idention would tell the python interpreter that the line under the header are the statements and should be followed. Without it the interpreter wouldn't see it as a statement.
# What is the difference between = and ==? - = means the assignment while == means equal to.
