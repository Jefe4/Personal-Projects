# A program is specific set of ordered operations for a computer to execute.
# Python is a programming language that can be read by the programmer and computer. So the programmer can give a set of orders through python so that the computer can interprete the set of orders.
# When you divide an integer by a float will show decimals if there's a remainer. When you divide a float by an integer than the results will always be rounded not showing the exact amount including decimals.
